# Car registry

An open sourced implementation of a car registry. Please submit your issues and pull requests here.

## Use it for YOUR favorite car

I made this because of the love for _my_ favorite car - the Porsche 911 (993).

If you have a small amount of programming skills, you can set one up yourself. Fork this
project, and apply your own stylistic changes in a ``theme.css`` file. 

Send me an email if you need support, or file issues for feature requests, bugs or whatever.

## Setup

You can setup the car registry on your local machine pretty easily. Just follow this little
guide, and you should have it up and running in no time.

This application is built with iojs (node), bower and mysql. Hopefully Gulp in the future. 

### Step 1: Install iojs,bower and mysql

	brew install iojs bower mysql

### Step 2: Install dependencies

	npm install
	bower install

### Step 3: Setup your database with some dummy data

Haven't made this yet, but will come soon.
